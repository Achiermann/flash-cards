ONLY follow the following instructions if explicitly told:

<!-- .1 Task -->

changing the height property for ".flashcard .wordlist-item-archive svg" will just increase the hight for the container of the actual icon, which will only affect the icons position in the end. I want to make the actual icon bigger.

<!-- .2 Disclaimer -->

Don`t make any other changes then the ones explicitly mentioned here or in any of the mentioned instruction-files.
**Make USE of Vercel and Supabase MCP**
**You dont have to push changes to gitHub, ill do that manually**
